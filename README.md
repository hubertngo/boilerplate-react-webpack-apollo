## Installing and Running

### Procedures:

1. Check if your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version is >= 8.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Change the package's `name`, `description`, and `repository` fields in `package.json`.
4. Change the name of your extension on `public/manifest.json`.
5. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies.
6. Run `yarn dev` for development.
6. Run `yarn build` and `yarn start` for production.

## Secrets

If you are developing an extension that talks with some API you probably are using different keys for testing and production. Is a good practice you not commit your secret keys and expose to anyone that have access to the repository.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Add environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of `NAME=VALUE`. For example:

```js
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=s1mpl3
```

`process.env` now has the keys and values you defined in your `.env` file.

```js
const db = require('db')
db.connect({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  username: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASS
})
```
